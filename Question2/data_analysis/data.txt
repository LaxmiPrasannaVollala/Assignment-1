Each visualization helps in analyzing different aspects of student performance.
Out of all,I observed that histogram which I have used for plotting the distribution of final grades, it showed the overall spread of student grades (how many students fall in different score ranges) and helps in identifying if scores are normally distributed. With this we can easily analyse if most students are scoring high, low, or somewhere in the middle.
We can also detect outliers like very low or very high scores.
