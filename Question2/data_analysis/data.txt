Each visualization helps in analyzing different aspects of student performance.
Histogram → Distribution of Final Grades:
-The graph displays the overall spread of student grades i.e., how many students fall in different score ranges.
The analysis from Histogram made easier in:
-Helps in identifying if scores are normally distributed.
-It easily analyse if most students are scoring high, low, or somewhere in the middle.
-It detect outliers like very low or very high scores.

Bar Chart → Average Scores by Gender:
-The graph shows the comparison of math, reading, and writing scores for male vs. female students.
The analysis from Bar chart made easier in:
-Identifing gender-based performance gaps in different subjects.
-Spotting if one gender is performing consistently better or worse in a particular subject.

Box Plot → Parental Education vs Final Grades:
-The graph shows how student's final grades impacted based on their parents' education level.
-It also shows the spread of grades and possible outliers for each parental education group.
The analysis from Box plot made easier in:
-Determining if higher parental education leads to higher student performance.
-Identifing if students of less-educated parents need additional academic support.

Pie Chart → Test Preparation Course vs. Pass/Fail Rate:
-The graph shows the percentage of students who passed or failed based on whether they took a test preparation course.
The analysis from pie chart made easier in:
-Quickly assess if test prep courses are effective in improving pass rates.
-Helps schools decide whether to encourage more students to take prep courses.

Scatter Plot → Math Score vs. Reading Score
-The graph displays whether students who perform well in math also score high in reading (or vice versa).
The analysis from scatter plot made easier in
-Detecting correlations between subjects (e.g., do good math students also excel in reading?).
-Helps in curriculum planning – if math and reading are strongly correlated, schools may link their teaching strategies.
-Identifies if students struggle in one subject while excelling in another (to provide targeted support).
